# IMGBucket

This is a work in progress, it will at the very least have image uploading

## How to use

Head on over to: http://imgbucket.herokuapp.com/

First of all, to access any of the features you must be logged in. 

Since free accounts have been temporarily disabled, I have provided a test account:

`email => test@email.com`

`password => password`

Then when you have logged in you will have access to all the features.

## Getting started locally

1. Clone this branch, then `cd` into the directory.
2. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `rake db:migrate`
5. Run `rails server`
6. Go to `localhost`

# IMGBucket

This is a work in progress, it will at the very least have image uploading

## How to use

Head on over to: http://imgbucket.herokuapp.com/

First of all, to access any of the features you must be logged in. 

Since free accounts have been temporarily disabled, I have provided a test account:

`email => test@email.com`

`password => password`

Then when you have logged in you will have access to all the features.

## Contributions

I actually don't mind if you submit contributions, so please send those pull requests!
